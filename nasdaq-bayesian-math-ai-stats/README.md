# Bayesian Stock and Commodity Market Analysis

This project provides a robust Python script for live, multi-market analysis of global equity and commodity data using Bayesian statistics and visualization. It supports major stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, LSE, HKEX, Euronext, Tokyo-SE, Shanghai-SE, Bombay-SE, NSE-India, etc.) and commodities (Gold, Oil, Silver, etc.). For markets without public APIs, web scraping is used where possible, with placeholders for easy extension.

Key concepts include Bayesian estimation of daily returns, volatility computation, and clear data visualization with Matplotlib. The code is modular, allowing for easy addition of new stock exchanges, commodities, or improvements to web scraping logic.

To get started, clone this repository and ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`, including `pymc3`, `yfinance`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `requests`, and `beautifulsoup4`.

Run the script using:
```bash
python bayesian_stock_prediction.py
```
You can customize the exchanges and tickers analyzed by editing the appropriate lists in the script. For unsupported exchanges, fill in the web scraping routines for live data.

Example output includes mean return, volatility, Bayesian posterior estimates, and price/return plots for each market and commodity.

For more details on Bayesian statistics, visit [PyMC3 documentation](https://docs.pymc.io/).
To get live equity and commodity tickers, see [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).

Feel free to fork and contribute improvements, such as new web scraping modules or additional market support.
