# Sorting Algorithms Project

A comprehensive collection of sorting algorithm implementations with visualizations and animations.

## Overview

This project contains Python implementations of fundamental sorting algorithms, complete with unit tests and interactive animations. It's designed for educational purposes and provides both theoretical understanding and visual representation of how different sorting algorithms work.

## Algorithms Included

### Basic Sorting Algorithms (`src/basic_sorting.py`)
- **Bubble Sort**: O(n²) - Simple comparison-based algorithm
- **Selection Sort**: O(n²) - Finds minimum element and places it at beginning
- **Insertion Sort**: O(n²) - Builds sorted array one item at a time
- **Merge Sort**: O(n log n) - Divide-and-conquer approach
- **Quick Sort**: O(n log n) average - Partition-based sorting

### Advanced Algorithms
- **Radix Sort**: O(d × (n + k)) - Non-comparison based sorting for integers

## Interactive Animations

The project includes matplotlib-based animations that visualize how each algorithm works:

- `quicksort_animation.py` - Watch quicksort partition and sort data
- `radix_sort_animation.py` - See how radix sort processes digits
- Random data variants for testing with different inputs
