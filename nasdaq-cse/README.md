| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Low Liquidity      | Few participants → high volatility          | Investor education, incentives for market makers |

## 8. Gold Futures Investor Behavior

**Phases:**

1. Early Stage (2025-2026): Speculation-driven, low liquidity, hedging by jewellers
2. Growth Stage (2026-2027): Balanced hedging & speculation, higher participation, arbitrage emerges
3. Mature Stage (2028+): Diversified strategies, physical delivery possible, institutional hedging

**Text Flow:**

```
Launch Phase → Speculation-driven, low liquidity
Growth Phase → Hedging + Speculation balance, higher liquidity
Mature Phase → Diversified strategies, physical delivery possible
```

---

## 9. Agricultural Market Expansion

**Steps:**

1. Pilot with storable crops (rice, wheat, jute) using Warehouse Receipt System
2. Develop storage infrastructure with certified warehouses
3. Train brokers & farmers on futures contracts
4. Launch cash-settled contracts → move to physical delivery once ready
5. Integrate financing (warehouse receipts as collateral)

**Benefits:**

- Transparent pricing → reduces middlemen exploitation
- Price stability for farmers → less distress selling
- Advance contracting → secure income before harvest
- Inventory financing → bank loans based on warehouse receipts
- Market stability and foreign investment attraction

**ASCII Comparison – Today vs Future:**

```
TODAY                             FUTURE
Farmer → Middleman → Wholesaler    Farmer → Warehouse Receipt → Exchange
Price guesswork                     Real-time benchmark price
No financing                        Loans via warehouse receipts
Distress selling                     Price hedging before harvest
```
